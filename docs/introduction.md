![Screenshot of dashboard](../docs/images/dashboard.png)

The dashboard consists of tiles which are, under the hood, Livewire components. They can update themselves via polling. 

You can use any of the pre-packaged tiles](/laravel-dashboard/v1/adding-tiles/overview) or [create your own](/laravel-dashboard/v1/adding-tiles/creating-your-own-tile).
