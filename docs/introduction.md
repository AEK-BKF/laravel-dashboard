**Currently, this package is not available. We'll release it as soon as we hit [50 sponsors on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/spatie).**

Using this package you can create a beautiful dashboard Like this one.

The dashboard consists of tiles which are, under the hood, Livewire components. They can update themselves via polling. 

You can use any of the [pre-packaged tiles](/laravel-dashboard/v1/adding-tiles/overview) or [create your own](/laravel-dashboard/v1/adding-tiles/creating-your-own-tile).
